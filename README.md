# Discord-SlimJet-Linux
Discord using slimjet wrapper
Zip download, and extract wherever
Run ```bash discord.sh```
# Why?
All custom lightweight clients were using wayyy more modifications than discord was comfortable with. Using them might get you banned. This should be(hopefully) lighter than stock discord, we need somebody to verify
#Why SlimJet(chromium based)and not midori(gtk?? or maybe electron???)?
It was leading to slowdown on my device
