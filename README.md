# Discord-SlimJet-Linux
Discord using slimjet wrapper
Copy Discord Folder in Home Directory so that it looks like ~/Discord/<files>
Run ```bash discord.sh```
# Why?
Cuz all custom lightweight clients were using wayyy more modifications than discord was comfortable with. This should be(hopefully) lighter than stock discord, we need somebody to verify
